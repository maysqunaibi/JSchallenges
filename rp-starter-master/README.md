# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

## What is OOP ?
programming paradime (style of programming) focusing on objects rather than funstions 

</br>

## Thinking in OOP :

>### Objects:
every thing around us is an object.
objects have two basic parts:

* Properties or attributes: color, brand, name.
* Behaviors or methods: isMoving(), getAge(), setWeight().

>### Classes:
* The class is basically a **blueprint (templet)** that contains all the objects properties and behaviors so we can reuse them (create more objects) **without duplicate our code**.

* Objects that we are creating them using Classes we called them **instances**
<br/>
Example:

```JavaScript
var sha7bor = Cat();
```
## Core concepts in oop:
* Object, property, and method
* Class
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Reusability/inheritance
* Polymorphism
